# Library_management

## Introduction:
In this project, we will demonstrate how to develop Library Management System using Java Swing library. This Library Management System allows you to add books details using a graphical user interface (GUI) application. This system is build using the Java Swing package which gives a flexible set of components that can be use to build a Graphical user interface(GUI). This application has an easy and simple design with buttons to add books, view books list, edit the details, delete the book, clear the text fields and exit application. So take a seat, pour a cup of coffee and start using Library management system.

## Explanation:
This library management System is a Graphical user interface(GUI) system that allows user to easily add the book details, view the list of books, edit the details, delete the book record, clear the fields and exit the application using buttons. Users may very quickly add, view, edit and delete the books using the system’s simple design. The library management System has simple design with buttons and Text Fields. The user can enter details in Text field and then can add the book using add button.

The users may add book details using ‘add’ button, view list of added books using ‘view’ button, edit details using ‘edit’ button, delete record using ‘delete’ button, reset the fields using ‘clear’ button and can exit the application using ‘exit’ button. The user can enter details in Text field and then can add the book using add button.

The Java Swing library which gives a flexible and powerful set of components is used to develop the Library Management System. The system makes use of Swing components such as JLabel, JTextField, JButton, JTable and JPanel among many other Swing components. Button event is handled by the ActionListener interface and button events are defined using ActionListener’s actionPerformed() method.

Methods used in the project:

actionPerformed():

The action or events of the buttons are handled using this method. Buttons in the system to add the book details, to view the list of books, to edit the details, to delete the book record, to clear the fields and to exit the application are handled using this method. This method describe how the components should behave after the button is click.
